Write an algorithm to Convert Numbers to Letters. Create a function, which takes an integer number as input and return letter. 
For Example 1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, ........... 25 = Y, 26, Z, 27 = AA,..... 51 = AY, 52 = AZ, 53 = BA, ......  

Valid palindrome.

Add empty character in a string.

Reverse word in a sting.

I was not prepared for SQLs and asked quite a few questions on SQL joins.

1. Remove comments from JSON files

2. How to find if two graphs are connected and what's the shortest distance between given two nodes. 

Asked me about project and question on core Java libraries. HashMap, Hashtable, multithreading etc. 

1. Implement single linkedList, 

Implement iterator methods hashNext and next. 

Design a dashboard system to show sales data, 
Design a database schema for University ( students, courses, professors etc ), 

write a program to give the first non repeating character. Few more questions on Java.

was asked abt blocking queue .

was asked to implement a simple producer / consumer prob , which I did - had studied it the prev day .
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/producer-consumer-solution-using-semaphores-java/

implement LL w/o using the builtin collection

binary search , 

find max continuous sum in array , 

cycle in linked list

overall questions werent too hard , i didnt answer java specific questions all that well 

how does hashmap work?  

1.Multi Threading : Print Even-Odd 
2. Intersection of Linked Lists 
3. nxn Matrix question 
4. Grouping of same integers placed sequentially in an array.  

Explain the thread synchronization
Print odd and even numbers in sequence using threads  

reverse a linkedlist
mirror a BST
delete a node
height of the tree  

insert , delete element into sorted circular list

[Offer]
Can't disclose the questions. But for me, there was high conncentation in 
core JAVA, 
multi threading, 
Operating Systems (Memory Management specifically), 
Datastructures (not to limited to stacks,trees,linkedlists be prepared to answer in threaded and n-ary trees as well), 
SQL join related queries and there was a question related to a specific scenario in of the teams related to database pooling and policies to related to how would you implement a queue in such scenarios to process the user requests. I don't exactly remember this.  

Multithreading, Question write a dead lock in Java
